## üöÄ EXECUTION STRATEGY

I will:
1. Build each module completely before moving to the next
2. Create production-ready code (not placeholders)
3. Ensure proper integration with existing system
4. Add comprehensive features
5. Test each component
6. Commit after each module completion

Let's begin! üéä
