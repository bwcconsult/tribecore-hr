# üîß Enterprise Pages - Comprehensive Fix Plan

## Issues Identified:

1. **Compensation, Skills, Positions** - Blank white screens (API errors causing crashes)
2. **ISO 30414** - "Generate Report" button does nothing
3. **Cases & HRSD** - "Create Case" button does nothing
4. **AI Governance** - "Register AI System" navigates away instead of showing modal

## Root Cause:

All pages are trying to call backend APIs that don't exist yet, causing React Query errors that crash the components.

## Solution:

Rewrite all pages with:
1. **Mock data** instead of API calls (backend integration comes later)
2. **Working modals** for all "Create" buttons
3. **Proper error boundaries**
4. **Toast notifications** for user feedback

## Files Being Fixed:

- ‚úÖ `CompensationPage.tsx` - DONE (modal added, mock data working)
- ‚è≥ `SkillsPage.tsx` - Needs modal + mock data
- ‚è≥ `PositionsPage.tsx` - Needs modal + mock data  
- ‚è≥ `ISO30414Dashboard.tsx` - Needs report generation flow
- ‚è≥ `CasesPage.tsx` - Needs create case modal
- ‚è≥ `AIGovernanceDashboard.tsx` - Fix register button (modal not redirect)

## Implementation:

I'm creating complete rewrites for each page now...
