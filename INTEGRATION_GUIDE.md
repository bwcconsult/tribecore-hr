## 🚀 **HOW TO USE IT ALL TOGETHER**

### **Scenario 1: Annual Compensation Review**
```
1. HR uses YOUR payroll data
   ├── Current salaries
   ├── Bonus history
   └── Payment records

2. HR creates reviews in MY compensation module
   ├── Salary band comparison
   ├── Compa-ratio analysis
   └── Pay equity check

3. Results flow back to YOUR payroll
   ├── Update employee salary
   ├── Process in next payroll run
   └── Generate payslips with new amount
```

### **Scenario 2: Employee Has Payroll Question**
```
1. Employee creates case in MY HRSD
   ├── Type: Payroll question
   ├── Priority: Medium
   └── SLA: 8 hours

2. HR accesses YOUR payroll system
   ├── View payslip history
   ├── Check deductions
   └── Find answer

3. HR resolves case in HRSD
   ├── Log resolution
   ├── Update knowledge base
   └── Close case (CSAT survey)
```

### **Scenario 3: Workforce Planning**
```
1. HR reviews MY position data
   ├── Current positions
   ├── Vacancies
   └── Budget allocation

2. Cross-reference with YOUR employees
   ├── Who fills which position?
   ├── Where are the gaps?
   └── What skills are missing?

3. Use MY skills cloud
   ├── Identify skill gaps
   ├── Post internal opportunities
   └── Match talent to needs

4. Track in MY ISO 30414
   ├── Headcount trends
   ├── Fill rate
   └── Time to fill
```

# 4. Verify modules
```

### **Option 2: Manual (Step by Step)**
```bash
# 1. Database setup
psql -U postgres -d tribecore_db -f backend/migrations/create-ai-governance-hrsd-tables.sql
psql -U postgres -d tribecore_db -f backend/migrations/create-enterprise-modules-tables.sql

# 2. Backend registration (edit app.module.ts)
# Add 7 module imports (see MODULE_REGISTRATION_GUIDE.md)

# 3. Start services
cd backend && npm run start:dev
