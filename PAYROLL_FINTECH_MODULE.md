## 💼 Business Logic

### **EWA Calculation Algorithm**

```typescript
1. Calculate earned wages:
   - hoursWorked × hourlyRate = baseEarnings
   - baseEarnings - deductions = netEligible

2. Apply access limit:
   - availableForAccess = netEligible × accessLimitPercentage (default 50%)

3. Deduct previous advances:
   - finalAvailable = availableForAccess - previousAdvances

4. Calculate fees:
   - fee = (requestedAmount × feePercentage) + fixedFee
   - totalRepayment = requestedAmount + fee

5. Auto-approval logic:
   - If autoApprove enabled AND amount <= threshold
   - Then approve and disburse immediately
   - Else require manual approval
```

### **Instant Pay Fee Structure**

| Speed      | Delivery Time | Fee     |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| Instant    | 5-15 minutes  | 1.5%    |
| Same Day   | 6 hours       | 0.75%   |
| Next Day   | 24 hours      | 0.25%   |

### **Default Wallet Limits**

```typescript
{
  dailyWithdrawal: £1,000,
  weeklyWithdrawal: £5,000,
  monthlyWithdrawal: £20,000,
  perTransactionLimit: £500
}
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1. Enable Fintech for Organization**

The module auto-creates default configuration when first accessed:

```typescript
{
  ewaEnabled: true,
  instantPayEnabled: true,
  walletEnabled: true,
  ewaMaxPercentage: 50,          // Max % of earned wages
  ewaFeePercentage: 2.5,
  ewaMaxRequestsPerMonth: 3,
  autoApproveEWA: true,
  autoApproveThreshold: 500,
}
```

### **2. Create Employee Wallet**

```typescript
POST /api/v1/fintech/wallets
{
  "employeeId": "emp-123",
  "organizationId": "org-123",
  "currency": "GBP"
}
```

### **3. Configure Payment Rail**

```typescript
POST /api/v1/fintech/payment-rails
{
  "organizationId": "org-123",
  "name": "UK Faster Payments",
  "type": "FASTER_PAYMENTS",
  "provider": "Stripe",
  "supportedCurrencies": ["GBP"],
  "supportedCountries": ["GB"],
  "isInstant": true,
  "feePercentage": 1.0
}
```

### **4. Employee Makes EWA Request**

Employee navigates to **My Wallet → Access Earnings** and submits request. If auto-approval enabled, funds are instantly credited to wallet.

### **5. Employee Uses Instant Pay**

Employee navigates to **My Wallet → Instant Pay**, selects speed tier, enters amount, and initiates transfer. Funds are transferred to their bank account based on selected speed.
